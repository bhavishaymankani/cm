Deploying and managing Software-Defined Networking (SDN) infrastructure using System Center Virtual Machine Manager (SCVMM) 2019 involves several steps to configure virtual networking components and manage network resources efficiently. Here's a general guide to deploying and managing SDN infrastructure using SCVMM 2019:

Prerequisites:
Infrastructure Requirements:

Ensure that you have a compatible hardware setup capable of supporting SDN features.
Verify that your servers meet the requirements for running SCVMM 2019.
Software Requirements:

Install Windows Server 2019 on the servers designated for SCVMM and SDN components.
Deploy System Center Virtual Machine Manager 2019.
Networking Infrastructure:

Configure physical networking components such as switches, routers, and network adapters to support SDN deployment.
Ensure that network connectivity is established between SCVMM servers, Hyper-V hosts, and other network devices.
Hyper-V Hosts:

Set up Hyper-V hosts running Windows Server 2019 to host virtual machines (VMs) and participate in the SDN infrastructure.
Deployment Steps:
Install and Configure SCVMM 2019:

Install SCVMM 2019 on a dedicated server or virtual machine.
Configure SCVMM with the necessary settings and credentials to manage your Hyper-V hosts and SDN infrastructure.
Configure SDN Infrastructure:

Use SCVMM to configure the SDN infrastructure components, including:
Software Load Balancer (SLB)
Gateway
Network Controller
Virtual Network Functions (VNFs)
Create Logical Networks:

Define logical networks in SCVMM to abstract the underlying physical network infrastructure.
Create logical switches to represent virtual network segments with specific configurations.
Deploy Network Virtualization:

Enable network virtualization on Hyper-V hosts to support isolated virtual networks.
Configure Network Virtualization Gateways (NVGRE or VXLAN) to facilitate communication between virtual networks and external networks.
Create and Manage Virtual Networks:

Use SCVMM to create and manage virtual networks based on the defined logical networks and switches.
Configure network settings for VMs, including IP address assignments, VLAN tagging, and Quality of Service (QoS) policies.
Monitor and Manage SDN Resources:

Monitor the health and performance of SDN infrastructure components using SCVMM monitoring features.
Perform routine management tasks such as adding/removing virtual network adapters, modifying network configurations, and troubleshooting network issues.
Scaling and Expansion:

Scale out the SDN infrastructure by adding additional Hyper-V hosts or network controllers as needed.
Expand the virtual network infrastructure to accommodate new workloads or changes in network requirements.
Backup and Disaster Recovery:

Implement backup and disaster recovery strategies for SDN infrastructure components, including network controller databases and configuration settings.
Integration with Other System Center Components:

Integrate SCVMM with other System Center components such as Operations Manager (SCOM) for enhanced monitoring and Service Manager for IT service management.
By following these steps, you can deploy and manage SDN infrastructure using SCVMM 2019, enabling flexible, scalable, and efficient network virtualization in your environment. Adjust the deployment process based on your specific requirements and infrastructure setup.
